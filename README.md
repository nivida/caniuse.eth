### WIP

Don't judge as long as WIP stands here. Just started to wildly architect to find a reasonable architecture. (First time architecting in Go)

# caniuse.eth

Will test all the existing JSON-RPC methods of an Ethereum node or wallet. Additionally it will test the OPCODES of the implemented EVM.
All of it should be displayed on a caniuse.eth website in the look and feel of the well known caniuse.com website.
