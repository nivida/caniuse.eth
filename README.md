### WIP

Don't judge as long as WIP stands here. Just started to wildly architect to find a reasonable architecture. (First time architecting in Go)

TODO's:

- Finish the base architecture
- Test all existing JSON-RPC methods of existing Ethereum Nodes (This includes the Aleth or Paritiy specific methods as well)
- Test all EVM OPCODES
- Test Wallet specific methods as for example ```eth_signTypedData```
- Test services as for example Infura
- Create CLI UI
- Create Static Site generator
- Create GitHub hooks to automatically run the test suite against a node or service as soon as a new release of it is on GitHub
- Publish the static site on netlify or IPFS (Let me see what fits more) after each new build


# caniuse.eth

Will test all the existing JSON-RPC methods of an Ethereum node or wallet. Additionally, will it test the OPCODES of the implemented EVM.
All of it should be displayed on a caniuse.eth website in the look and feel of the well known caniuse.com website.
